      "description": "Sure, people come to L.A. to see the palm trees, the hills and the ocean. But when you walk these streets on the regular, you become much more attuned to L.A.’s more everyday sights—and that’s especially true for the artists in this photography show. Discover beauty in L.A.’s most mundane, overlooked details at this assembly of works from nine SoCal photographers. You’ll find the show, from munDAAANG! magazine and ArtShareLA, at Angel City Brewery (after an opening reception, you can scope it out during the brewery’s regular operating hours)."

Pacific Opera Project will tackle Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods on the main lawn of Descanso Gardens. Tickets are currently sold out, but you can email Pacific Opera Project to be added to the waitlist (come on, this is L.A.—you know at least a few people are going to flake)."

      "description": "Avalon is one of Hollywood’s most historic landmarks. From The Beatles first West Coast performance in 1964 to ABC’s hit ‘Hollywood Palace’ hosted by Jerry Lewis and Sasha’s first West Coast DJ residency, the theater at Hollywood and Vine has been a show-business epicenter since opening in 1927.\n\nThis is it – the big daddy. Set in Hollywood proper directly across the street from the iconic Capitol Records building on Vine, Avalon Hollywood (formerly known as The Palace) offers a big night out experience. A converted theater with an EAW sound system, Avalon hosts Tigerheat on Thursday for the gay/mixed crowd, Control on Friday for alternative electronic dance acts, and their own Avalon night on Saturday for world-famous DJs like Paul Oakenfold and Kevin Saunderson. A little planning goes a long way - for big nights, buying presale tickets is highly recommended.",
